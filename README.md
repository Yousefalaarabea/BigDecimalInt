# BigDecimalInt
Different variations of types int and float exist in C++ and other languages. They are =
limited by minimum and maximum values depending on the number of bytes used to store the 
number. We need versions of these types with unlimited bounds. Java solves this problem by 
providing BigInteger and BigDecimal classes. In this problem it is required to develop a 
new C++ type (class) that can hold unlimited decimal integer values and performs arithmetic 
operations on them.
